 Loops:
 Loops in function are used to reapeat accions efficiently.The main types of loop are-
 1. for loop which is used for sequential traversal. Itâ€™s commonly used to automate repetitive tasks or iterate through elements. We use for loop when we know how many loops will be there.

 2. while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. And when the condition becomes false,the line immidiately after the loop in the program is executed. while loop is basically based on conditions.We use while loop in a program when we dont know how long loops will run.

 Function:
 In python,function is a block of satements that return the specific task.Instead of writing the same code repeatedly for different inputs,we can call the function.
 
 To run a program with funcion we have to follow some synteax:
 
 def: This is the keyword which is used for defining a fuction.

 function_name: To call the function we have to give the function a name.

 parameters: These are inputs that the function can accept. we can also define a function with no parameters as well.

 return:the return statement is used to exit a function and send a value back to the place where the function was called. When a function is called, it performs its task, and if there is a return statement, it will return a result to the caller. Without a return statement, a function will return None by default.
